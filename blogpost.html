        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in 1962 and received his own title in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp and the Hulk. Iron Man stories have been published consistently since the character's creation. Iron Man is the superhero persona of Tony Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection and other abilities. Robert Downey Jr. (pictured) portrayed Tony Stark from 2008 to 2019. His portrayal popularized the character, making Iron Man one of Marvel's most recognizable superheroes. (Full article...)
